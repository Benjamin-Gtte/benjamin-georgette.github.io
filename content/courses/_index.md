##### School year 2023 - 2024
- Mécanique des Systèmes for 2nd year student at INSA de Lyon. I had a group of 26 students each week, to teach them from the basics of kinematics, statics, to be able, at the end of the year, to solve complex dynamical problems of general mechanics. *Total of 44 hours*
-  Mécanique du Solide for 3rd year students at INSA de Lyon. Laboratory work for 3rd year students, teaching them the basics of continnuum mechanics and strength of materials. 2 exercices: the first one was different flexion tests on a plexiglas beam with strain gauges, and the second one was image correlation on a bloc of elastomer. *Total of 20 hours*

##### School year 2024 - 2025
- Mécanique des Systèmes for 2nd year student at INSA de Lyon. *Ibid* *Total of 44 hours*
  Mécanique des Solides Déformables for 3rd year students at INSA de Lyon. *Same course as "Mécanique du Solide"* *Total of 16 hours*
  Mécanique des Solides Déformables for 3rd year students at INSA de Lyon. Exercices of introduction about continuum mechanics. *Total of 12 hours*
